**Repository of dotfiles

This repository includes custimized config files for various programs, as well as an install script for a wider set of tools I commonly use.

The intent is to be able to quickly and easily get up and running should I need to setup a new machine.

## Usage

Clone this repository and use the `stow` command to symlink the configs you want to use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zerossive/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow bin git bin ...
```
